👨‍🚀 Astronauts vs 👾 Aliens – Who’s gonna win the ultimate space battle?  

Hey there! I built this fun little Tic-Tac-Toe game where astronauts and aliens face off in a galactic showdown. It’s simple, clean, and works right in your browser. Perfect for a quick game when you need a break from conquering the universe (or studying).
